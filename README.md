# Animal-Clinic-Database-Management-System

Project Overview: This project was created during a Concepts of Database Systems course. I created a fully functional database system from scratch for a potential animal clinic. I created an ER schema diagram, relational schemas, queries, tables, and forms along with utilizing SQL to implement queries into Access. Lastly, I integrated potential data into the database system and completed many tests to assure accuracy.
