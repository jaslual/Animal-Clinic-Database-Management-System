# Animal-Clinic-Database-Management-System

Project Overview: 
This project was created during a Concepts of Database Systems course. I created a fully functional database system from scratch for a hypothetical animal clinic. I created an ER schema diagram, relational schemas, queries, tables, and forms along with utilizing SQL to implement queries into Access. Lastly, I integrated sample data into the database system to simulate real-world usage and completed many tests to assure accuracy.

The Database Final Project pdf helps show the steps I took to create the final database system and further explains what the queries accomplish. It helps show what I wanted to database system to look like, a summary of each table, and explanations for the schemas.

Download Instructions: 
The Bronze Animal Clinic Database Management System file is a .accdb file which can only be opened using Microsoft Access.
